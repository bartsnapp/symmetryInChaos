## Questions you know the answer to

1. What is a formula that will yield a pretty graph?
2. How many joints are there in the graph?
3. How many axes are there that pass through the central point make the graph symmetry?
4. What is the largest number of sections that will generate the graph by rotation and translation?
5. How many joints that seems important in the graph? 
6. Why there are six very dense points on each circle?
7. Why are there six dense line in the graph?
8. Does special number "six" related to the value of n?
-Yes




## Questions you think can answer with some work


1. How do we derive the formula for f that we are using?
2. Are there other options for the formula for f?
3. What happens if we look at f(random-complex-point) and plot a
   million of these?
4. What does the joints mean in the graph?
5. Can we get formulas that can plot all joints on the graph?  
-- By joint, we mean intersections of the "curves" that we see on the
-- graph.


6. How can we plot a single section of the graph? 
-- Since the iteration of f is chaotic, it is impossible to control f.
-- rather, we should find points, and then use matrices to shove them
-- into a wedge of 30 degrees from the x-axis.


7. Why there seems like two concentric circle (or hexago)?
8. While iteration is 100,000 we can see two concentric circle (or hexagon) 
and iterate 1,000,000 we see three concentric hexagon. What about more 
iteration? Does it means that the details of the graph is infinite?
9. Will the graph be infinite concentric circle(or hexagon)?
10. Can we prove Q9 with proving there are infinite joints?

11. Consider a "slice" of the D_n symmetry, place points (non)randomly
    into this slice. Consider these to be the iterative values of some
    unknown continuous (differentiable?) function. If the behavior of
    the iteration of the function is truly chaotic then at some point
    two points in the iteration will be near each other, can we then
    use calculus to interpolate where the future values could be? 
    
12. How the number of n related to the graph?

13. There are several concentric figure in the graph such as hexagon and 
hexagram. Does the largest distance from those figure to the center of the 
graph for concentric figures from outer to inner forms a decreasing arithmetic
sequenceï¼Ÿ

14. If Q13 is true, can we plot only one outer figure and shrink the graph
by a constant and place it in the outer figure, then we can get figure with 
infinite details?

15.  How many concentric (simmilar) figures are there? Why they exist?
Are they absolutely simmilar?

16.  Can we express concentric figures in the graph with formulas with simmilar 
formula but different values in variables?




## Questions you have no idea how to answer

1. In the plots of the symmetric icons, we see "curves" what are these curves?
2. Sometimes the icon looks like a projection of a higher dimensional
   surface onto the plane. Is this the case?
3. Is there any possibility that plotting the graph faster?
4. How can we get an accurate graph by just have all these joints?
5. Do more curves appear as we increase the iterations? Or does the image stabilize?
